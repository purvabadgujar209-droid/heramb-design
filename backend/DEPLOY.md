# Putting your backend online (free, ~5 minutes)

Your website's payment/enquiry form needs somewhere to save customer details.
That "somewhere" is this `backend` folder. It needs to run on a server that's
online all the time — not on your own laptop. **Render** offers this for free.

You will end up with a private admin address like:
`https://your-site-name.netlify.app/admin.html`
that only you can log into with a password.

---

## Step 1 — Put your code on GitHub

1. Go to **https://github.com** and create a free account if you don't have one.
2. Create a new repository (e.g. `heramb-website`), and upload your whole
   `heramb-website` folder (which includes this `backend` folder inside it).
   You can drag-and-drop files directly on the GitHub website — no command
   line needed.

## Step 2 — Deploy the backend on Render

1. Go to **https://render.com** and sign up (free) — you can sign up directly
   with your GitHub account, which makes step 3 easier.
2. Click **New +** → **Web Service**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository from Step 1.
4. When asked to configure the service:
   - **Root Directory:** `backend`  *(important — tells Render to only run the backend folder)*
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
   - **Instance Type:** Free
5. Under **Environment Variables**, add these (click "Add Environment Variable" for each):
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` → choose a strong password only you know
   - `SESSION_SECRET` → any long random string (mash your keyboard, 30+ characters)
   - `UPI_ID` → `9421990387@ybl`
   - `NODE_ENV` → `production`
6. Click **Create Web Service**. Wait 2–3 minutes while it builds.
7. When it's done, Render gives you a URL like:
   `https://heramb-backend.onrender.com`
   — copy this, you'll need it next.

**Note:** Render's free tier "sleeps" the server after 15 minutes of no
traffic, so the very first request after a quiet period can take ~30 seconds
to wake up. That's fine for a small business site — the form will just show
a brief loading state.

## Step 3 — Point your website at the backend

1. Open `heramb-website/config.js` in your website folder.
2. Replace the URL inside the quotes with the Render URL from Step 2, e.g.:
   ```js
   window.HERAMB_API_BASE = "https://heramb-backend.onrender.com";
   ```
3. Re-upload/redeploy your website files (same drag-and-drop Netlify step
   from the main guide) so the updated `config.js` goes live.

## Step 4 — Log in to your admin panel

1. Visit `https://your-website-address/admin.html`
2. Enter the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you chose in Step 2.
3. You'll see every customer enquiry: name, phone, service, amount, message,
   date, and a status you can update (new / contacted / paid / completed / spam).

Keep the `admin.html` address and password private — don't link to it from
your public menu.

## Running it on your own computer first (optional, to test)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# open .env and set your own ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm start
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:4000`. Leave `config.js` set to
`http://localhost:4000` while testing locally, then switch it to your Render
URL before going live (Step 3 above).
